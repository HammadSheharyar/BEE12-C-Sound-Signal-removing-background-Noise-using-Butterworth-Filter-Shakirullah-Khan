Abstract:
This project aims to enhance sound signals by removing background noise using a Butterworth filter. Background noise can significantly degrade the quality of audio recordings, making it difficult to extract useful information or enjoy a clear listening experience.By applying the Butterworth filter, which is a type of infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, unwanted noise frequencies can be attenuated while preserving the desired signal components.
The project involves the following key steps:
1) Signal Acquisition: Audio recordings containing both the desired signal and background noise are captured using suitable recording devices or retrieved from existing audio sources.
2) Preprocessing: The acquired audio signals are preprocessed to remove any artifacts or unwanted components that may interfere with the subsequent filtering process.
3) Butterworth Filter Design: The Butterworth filter is designed based on the desired cutoff frequency and filter order. The filter's specifications are determined to achieve optimal noise attenuation while minimizing distortion and signal loss.
4) Filtering Process: The Butterworth filter is applied to the audio signals, selectively attenuating frequencies associated with the background noise while preserving the desired signal. The filter can be implemented in real-time or as an offline process, depending on the application requirements.
5) Evaluation and Quality Assessment: The filtered audio signals are evaluated to assess the effectiveness of the noise reduction process. Objective metrics and subjective listening tests may be employed to measure the quality improvement achieved.


The successful completion of this project will result in improved sound signal quality, with reduced background noise and enhanced intelligibility. The application of the Butterworth filter offers a flexible and efficient approach to noise reduction in various audio applications, such as speech recognition, audio recordings, telecommunications, and multimedia systems.
